          <h4>THE EXPERIENCE</h4>
          <h3>HOW IT BEGINS</h3>
          <p>
            The one thing that I love about meeting a client for the first time
            is getting to know you. But most importantly just sitting and
            talking with you and becoming friends. The connection I strive to
            make with my clients is really special and can only be described as
            a friendship. I don’t want to be just your photographer.
          </p>
          <p class="xp">
            I want to become your friend. So that no matter if it's your
            wedding, family, senior or newborn session - you know that I'll do
            everything in my power to make it perfect. I'll capture the images
            and moments you have dreamed of and will cherish in the years to
            come.

            THROUGH THIS PROCESS, ABEL HAS BECOME ONE OF OUR BEST FRIENDS AS A
            COUPLE
          </h3>
          <p>
            The day we got engaged, we contacted Abel right off the bat and
            asked him to take a few announcement pictures with us and he was so
            accommodating to help us get this done quickly. From our two sets of
            engagement pictures all the way to the last hug we gave him on his
            way out, he was nothing short of AMAZING. He wanted to make our
            visions come to life and wanted to make sure that we loved
            absolutely every picture. Abel was not only our wedding photographer
            and friend, but will be with our family for years to come as we know
            without a doubt he will be photographing us once we start a family!

            Abel's photography skills are not just breathtaking; his approach to
            client care is truly remarkable. From the moment you meet him, he
            warmly welcomes you into a friendship rather than a mere business
            transaction. He goes above and beyond to ensure that your desires
            and dreams are his top priority, regardless of the financial or time
            constraints. With Abel, each session is a delightful adventure
            filled with laughter, innovative ideas, and customized poses that
            capture your unique essence. His dedication to tailoring every
            aspect of the experience to your needs is evident in every
            interaction. I could talk endlessly about how amazing Abel is, but
            suffice it to say, I enthusiastically recommend Rehoboth Photography
            to anyone in search of a truly unforgettable photography experience.

          <h3>ABEL IS THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHER I HAVE EVER MET</h3>
          <p>
            Abel is an absolute gem of a photographer! Recently, he graciously
            took on the task of capturing my maternity photos, and let me tell
            you, it was an experience I'll cherish forever. Not only did he make
            the session incredibly fun and memorable, but he also effortlessly
            encapsulated our silly personalities, joining in our laughter and
            jokes along the way. The comfort he exuded throughout the shoot was
            truly remarkable. When I received the final photos, I was blown away
            by how perfectly he had captured each moment. Abel's talent behind
            the camera knows no bounds, and I simply can't sing his praises
            enough. Without hesitation, I highly recommend him to anyone seeking
            a photographer who not only delivers exceptional results but also
            ensures a joyous and unforgettable experience. I'm already looking
            forward to our next session!
